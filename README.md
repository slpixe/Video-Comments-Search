# Video Comments Search

## Purpose

This currently allows you to enter a youtube video id (e.g. `kJQP7kiw5Fk`) and search query to get back all the comments from that listing on Youtube.

The best use of this is for trying to find a comment mentioning which song is playing in the video if its not in the meta-info
